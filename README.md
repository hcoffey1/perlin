# Perlin Noise Visualization in Rust

## Intro

This is a toy project that demos some renderings
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin
Noise</a> and SDL2 in Rust (this was mainly an excuse
for me to learn a bit about Rust).

## Usage
`cargo run`

Changing the output currently involves changing the method
called in `main()`.

## Examples
A flesh-like texture:
